# Lotto
> *Get discouraged by seeing how many lifetimes it would take to win with your go-to lotto numbers!*

This Lotto program is my first Java project ever! It can be used check how many lifetimes it would take to win with lotto numbers of your choice. The program contains f.e. packages, documentation and a selection sort algorithm.

## Motivation
As of creating this program, I have studied BIS for only two months. I am so excited to finally have a sort-of real project to do. While programming, I learned a lot of new things regarding Java and programming in general.
